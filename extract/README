In this directory are the scripts needed to extract data from Voyager.

Copy the voyagerDB-directory to the Voyager DB server and configure per instructions in the README/config-file.

Afterwards you must define the pipeline automation script which connects from Koha-server to the VoyagerDB-server to get the data out.
This directory has example implementations which you can use as a basis to build your own glue between migration phases.
