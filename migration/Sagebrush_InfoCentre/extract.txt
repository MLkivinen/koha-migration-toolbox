Request BACKUP copy of the Sagebrush/InfoCentre database.

****Notes from Converse Free
The database backup file we sent you was created with the "osql" command 
on our server (Windows Server 2003, version 5.2 SP2). Specifically, we use 
a script daily to create backups. The exact osql command in that script is:

osql -U sa -P sagepw -S 127.0.0.1\Sagebrush -Q "backup database IC to disk = 'C:\InfoCentreServer\data\InfoCentre\backups\new_file.backup' with INIT"
*************

The backup file (in the above example was called 201109150920_IC.backup) is
dropped into the Dropbox.
